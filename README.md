# Schrodinger-Equation-vs-Real-Experimental-Data

This is an ongoing project designed to use data from the University of Glasgow's Video recording true single-photon double-slit interference (http://researchdata.gla.ac.uk/281/) and to compare the results to the predictions generated by the time dependent schrodinger equation.

The code can be split into three phases:
1) Importing and cleaning the data from the real double slit experiment - experimental_data_processing.py
2) Simulating the expected results based on time-dependant Schrodinger equation.
3) Comparing the real experimental data to the simulated data.
