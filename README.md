# Schrodinger-Equation-vs-Real-Experimental-Data

This is an ongoing project designed to use data from the University of Glasgow's Video recording true single-photon double-slit interference (http://researchdata.gla.ac.uk/281/) and to compare the results to the predictions generated by the time dependent schrodinger equation.

The code can be split into two functions:
1) Importing and cleaning the data from the real double slit experiment.
2) Comparing that data to what the Schrodinger equation would predict.
